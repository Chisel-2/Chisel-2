Added: Far more config-level configurability for the mod's available features and behaviour.
Changed: The config format. Cleaned it up a bit. Watch out!
Fixed: Marble stairs and limestone stairs now work!
Fixed: Partially attempted to fix the left-click-with-chisel to make block disappear bug.

Added: Chiselable Stained Glass and Stained Glass Panes.
Changed: Textures are now compressed with pngout, cutting the mod's size from 4MB to 2.1MB - an almost 50% reduction!
Changed: The internal mod-specific names used in the GameRegistry. worlds saved with Chisel 1.5.1 will *not* be compatible, and worlds saved with Minecraft 1.6.4 and below probably will not convert perfectly as well, but this was done for the better - mod collisions could've and would've happened otherwise.
Fixed: NPE with certain blocks' rendering.
